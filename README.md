## Tech Stack
* Wireframing: Figma
* IDE: VSC
* Frontend: [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [MapBox Gl](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/maps-sdk-for-react-native/)
  * React Native is a cross compatible framework that paired with expo allows you to bring your apps to life while in development phases
  * Material UI or Bootstrap / CSS Tailwind
  * MapBox is a community-maintained React Native library that provides reusable JavaScript components for integrating Mapbox maps into iOS and Android apps.
* Backend: [AWS Lambda](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda), [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) & [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) Or [Firebase/Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), [Express & Node](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction), [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), [MapBox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/)
  * AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources
  * DynamoDB and S3 continue with the fully AWS approach however, Firebase/Firestore work great as needed
  * By using Express and Node.js, you can effectively manage the backend of your mobile app, providing a robust API that interacts with your frontend mobile application
* User Authentication: [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs)

## Possible Roadblocks üß†
- AI Integration and Usage
    - Extra time for implementation and get started with research early on.
- Real-Time Voting System & Multiplayer
    - Get started early on or have multiple teams so the game can be played on a singular device.
